The waveform simulations in Xilinx Vivado verify the correct operation of the 4-bit up counter. The counter cycles through states 's0' to 's3' (binary 00 to 11) with each clock pulse. The waveforms show synchronized state transitions, proper clock-driven behavior, and correct reset functionality, ensuring reliable operation.These screenshots provide a clear visual verification of the counterâ€™s accurate and consistent performance.
