# 4-bit-Up-Counter-using-FSM
  This project features a 4-bit up counter using a Moore Machine FSM, cycling through binary values 00 to 11 with each clock pulse. Implemented in Xilinx Vivado, the counter requires no external inputs beyond the clock and reset. Itâ€™s a simple, reliable design verified through waveform simulation.
